OpenCPN temporary 5.9 Debian repository
=======================================

This repository contains opencpn 5.9.x backported to bookworm. The
packages here are uploaded to Debian. However, the Debian administrative
processes are quite slow making a pre-release repository useful.

To use the repository:

  - Add the repository to the apt sources:
       $ repo=http://mumin.crabdance.com/bookworm-backports
       $ wget -O- $repo/opencpn.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opencpn.list

  - Import the signing key:
       $ wget -O- $repo/KEY.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/opencpn.key

  - Update the apt catalog and install or update opencpn:
       $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install opencpn

The status of the official bookworm-backports repository is at the time of 
writing unclear. The file opencpn.list should be removed once the backport
is available from the official Debian repositories.
